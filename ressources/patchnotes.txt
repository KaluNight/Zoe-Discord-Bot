**V1.3.1 -> V1.3.2**

**One new option added + polish stats command**
A user asked a new feature allowing the creation of a "clean" channel. Messages sent in this channel are deleted after three seconds. This option has been created to simplify the creation of a registration system for servers that wants all members to be registered. Option to be used with options 2 and 4 for this type of use.
The command ">stats profile @mention" has been simplified, you can now directly use the command ">stats @mention".
