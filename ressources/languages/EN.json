To start, create an information channel with the command `>create infoChannel channelName`. You can also define an existing one with the command `>define infoChannel #mentionOfAChannel`.\n2. Then add the League of Legends players to the system using the command `>create player @MentionOfPlayer (ServerTag) (SummonerName)`. You can add a secondary account to a player with the command `>add accountToPlayer @mentionOfPlayer (ServerTag) (SummonerName)`\n3. You can use the command `>config` to config your server like you want.\n\nThat's it, your information system has been well implemented.
