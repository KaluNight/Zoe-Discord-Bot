Type `>commandName help` to get help about one specific command. Be also sure you have the right to manage the channels (Manage Channels permission).\n\n1. To start, create an information channel with the command `>create infoChannel channelName`. You can also define an existing one with the command `>define infoChannel #mentionOfAChannel`.\n2. Then add the League of Legends players to the system using the command `>create player @MentionOfPlayer (ServerTag) (SummonerName)`. You can add a secondary account to a player with the command `>add accountToPlayer @mentionOfPlayer (ServerTag) (SummonerName)`\n3. You can use the command `>config` to config your server like you want.\n\nThat's it, your information system has been well implemented. If you have questions, features requests or just discuss feel free to come here : https://discord.gg/whc5PrC\n*Note: The information panel is updated every 3 minutes, infocards sended in ~20 sec.*",
